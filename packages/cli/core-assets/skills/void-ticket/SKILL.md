description: Use when turning a finished brainstorm, plan, or design decision into a tracker ticket. Triggers on creating a ticket or issue, logging work, or breaking an approved spec into tickets.

# ticket

A ticket an implementation agent can execute with zero follow-up questions. It does NOT invent scope: it ingests what was already decided (the brainstorm, the plan, this conversation, the relevant ADR) and renders it as a complete, estimated, labeled work item in the tracker. Downstream, `void-implement` executes it.

**Core principle:** the ticket is the contract between the thinking and the building. Every required slot is filled or the ticket is not ready. Estimate and labels are not optional metadata, they are how the backlog stays pilotable.

**Attribution**: see `.source`.

---

## When to invoke

- After `void-brainstorm` or `void-plan` produced a decision or spec, to capture it as trackable work.
- When the user says create a ticket, log this, or break this into tickets.
- Always writes to the project's tracker (Linear / Jira / GitHub / ...). On a project with a fixed tracker, team, and label conventions, use them and do not re-ask.

Do NOT use this to execute a ticket (`void-implement`) or to sequence many steps (`void-plan`).

---

## Ingest first, do not invent

Pull from what already exists, in order: the approved spec/plan, the brainstorm decisions, this conversation's decisions, the applicable ADR(s), the code conventions. The ticket RECORDS decisions already made. If a load-bearing decision is missing, go get it or flag it. Do not guess scope into existence.

A `docs/specs/*.md` spec with `source: forge` in its frontmatter (the forge→harness artifact contract) is a first-class source: its 18 recon variables, winning design, and critique verdict already answer scope, persona, and constraints — ingest them, do not re-ask. A partial forge spec (missing critique, or an older `forge_version` field) is ingested for what it has, with the gaps listed as the ticket's open questions.

## Admission: a finding earns its place or it is dropped

Most of what reaches this skill is not a decision someone made, it is a defect someone
*noticed*. Those arrive without end, because reading code always finds another inconsistency,
and each one is defensible on its own. A backlog that admits them all stops being pilotable, and
the objective recedes while every individual step looks correct.

So a noticed defect is not admitted on its merits. It is compared against **the unit being built
right now**, judged against the program's stated objective, and there are three outcomes and one
slot:

1. **It blocks the current unit** — it is fixed inside that unit. No ticket.
2. **It beats the current unit** — it becomes the next unit, and nothing else starts until it is
   disposed of.
3. **It loses** — it is dropped. Not filed, not deferred, not "kept for later".

Dropped means lost, and that is the point. A genuine defect is rediscoverable by construction:
a skill that lies will lie to the next reader, and a run will trip on it again. The only thing
ever written down is **evidence that cannot be reconstructed** — a failure observed once, a
measurement — as one line carrying the command that replays it. Never the opinion, never the
proposed fix, because describing the fix is how a finding smuggles in a design.

Two things are not admissible at all:

- **A reading nobody asked for.** What you noticed in a file you were not convened on does not
  become work. If it matters, it will be found again by someone who was asked.
- **An ambition claim.** "This would be tenfold better" belongs to `void-brainstorm`, on a named
  subject, deliberately. During execution it is an escape hatch, and it is the one that grows
  plans.

State the comparison out loud when you drop something: what you found, and what it lost to. One
line. An arbitration nobody can see did not happen.

**Prose incoherence is a first-class defect**, in four forms: inside one skill, between two
skills, between the user's stated demand and a skill, and between a skill and the code it
describes. The last is this repository's repeat offender. It still goes through the comparison
above like anything else.

See the decision on a finding entering only by beating the work in progress.

## Search the tracker before you write

The backlog already answered part of this. Query it on the **subject**, never on
the title you are about to write: DEV-591 was called "unstable test suite" and
DEV-561 "test contention" — no shared word, same question, three days apart.
Search several phrasings of the thing itself, and include **closed** tickets: one
closed because the approach was wrong is exactly the one not to reopen unchanged.

An overlap means reading that ticket **in full** before deciding, not its title.
What costs a day is not the duplicate, it is the reasoning that was in the first
one: DEV-561 had established that an intermittent test is a question nobody has
answered rather than noise to isolate, and DEV-591 recommended what it forbade.

Then exactly one of two things, and creating in silence is neither:

- **enrich the existing ticket**, when the subject is the same;
- **create, linked, naming the difference** in one sentence, when the scope is
  deliberately disjoint.

Never merge two tickets on your own: a resemblance is not an identity, and that
call is the human's. Say what you searched and what came back — a search nobody
can see did not happen. If the tracker is unreachable, say so and keep writing;
a handoff blocked on a lookup is worse than a duplicate.

Thirty results means the terms were too broad, not the backlog too large.

## The ticket: required slots

Render into the tracker description. Every slot is REQUIRED unless marked optional. A missing required slot means the ticket is not ready.

- **Title**: `[Verb] [Subject]`, imperative.
- **Context**: why it exists; link to the broader goal / spec / ADR.
- **Scope**: in scope / out of scope.
- **Technical specs**: files and packages touched, applicable ADR, conventions and patterns to follow, third-party docs to ground in. Exhaustive enough that no unknown remains.
- **Acceptance criteria**: objectively verifiable checkboxes.
- **Definition of Done**: tests written and green, 0 lint / type errors, 0 regressions, plus ticket-specific items.
- **Edge cases and gotchas**: boundary behaviors, error / empty / loading states, failure modes. This is the all-angles slot; an empty one means angles were missed.
- **TDD mode**: defer to `void-tdd`'s path-based auto-selection; note an explicit override to strict only for a business-critical surface (auth, payments, security, money).
- **Runner passes that apply**: which `void-implement` conditional passes you expect to fire (architecture? migration safety? async/idempotency? E2E? UX/UI? deep security?). This is an accelerator HINT, not authoritative: the runner still evaluates every predicate itself and may add passes you did not list.

### Close the link, both ways

A ticket that cites its spec is half a link. Do both, in the same change:

1. The ticket body opens with the paths of the spec and the plan it comes from.
2. The `ticket:` field in each of those two files' frontmatter is filled with the
   tracker id just created.

Neither direction is optional, because each answers a question the other cannot.
From the ticket, the reasoning: why this shape, what was rejected, which
trade-off was taken. From the spec, whether the thinking was ever executed and
where it landed. A spec with no ticket is a decision nobody carried out, and
nothing says so today.

The asymmetry is deliberate and worth keeping in mind: the spec and the plan
live in the repository because they belong to the project and must survive the
tracker, while the ticket is execution state and is mutable by nature. Copying
the reasoning into the tracker would put it where a workspace change can lose
it; copying the status into the repository would give it two owners. Only the
link crosses.

If the project has no tracker, say so and stop: there is no ticket to write, and
the spec plus the plan already hold what would have gone in it.

Native tracker fields (REQUIRED, set the real field, not prose):

- **Estimate** (points / size). Never leave empty.
- **Labels** (at least one; reuse existing, create if genuinely new).
- **Parent epic / project** link.
- **Dependencies** (`blockedBy`) in the native field, not just text.
- **Priority**.

## Multi-ticket programme handoff

After creating a complete pool of two or more tickets intended to run across sessions, create
`.void/program.md` in the same change. Do this only after the plan and ticket pool are
human-approved and every native dependency is saved. A single standalone ticket does not need a
programme descriptor.

Use tracker-agnostic routing frontmatter:

```yaml
---
schemaVersion: 1
status: executing
program: <stable-program-slug>
plan: <repository-relative-plan-path>
spec: <repository-relative-spec-path>
progress:
  provider: <adapter capability id>
  scope: <native workspace/project/repository query>
  order: [<ordered immutable work-unit identifiers>]
  states:
    ready: [<native ready states>]
    started: [<native started states>]
    review: [<native review states>]
    done: [<native completed states>]
humanGates: [<ticket identifiers requiring explicit approval>]
autopilot:
  schemaVersion: 2
  enabled: <true | false>
---
```

The body states that the plan supplies global intent, the complete provider-native record is the
executable unit, native blocker relations decide readiness, and `void-implement` owns the per-unit
lifecycle. `progress.order` is the deterministic tie-break among simultaneously ready units; it is
scope, not mutable progress. Never store a current or next unit, copied status, assignee, or
completion checklist in the program or checkpoint.

The `void-autopilot` block is required, because consent to autonomous execution is never inferred from silence: a program that does not want it declares `enabled: false`. There is no merge gate to declare: the loop merges into the integration branch on a local review verdict, never into the branch that deploys, which `deployBranch` names when it is not the repository's default branch; a person who merges themselves says so with `void-machine autopilot merges --by-human`, local state and not the program. Add `deployBranch`, `clusterSize` (1..4), `base`, `verifyCommands` (argv arrays, run with `shell:false`) and `ownership.sequential` / `ownership.reconcileOnly` only when the program enables autopilot.

Do not replace an unrelated executing programme. Stop and surface the collision. When the same
programme already has a descriptor, preserve its routing unless the user explicitly changes
programme scope. Automatic selection requires a provider adapter that can read and update status,
relations, assignee, comments, and review evidence; if those capabilities are unavailable, do not
claim automatic continuity.

## All-angles sweep before saving

Run a quick expert sweep so nothing is missed, then fold what surfaces into Edge cases or the applicable-passes slot:

- **Architecture**: boundaries, data model, public types.
- **Data / migrations**: schema change, backfill, zero-downtime (flags the runner's migration-safety pass).
- **Security**: trust boundary, untrusted input, tenancy.
- **Async / idempotency**: email, webhook, job, single-use token, replay (flags the runner's async pass).
- **QA**: edge / error / empty states, the end-to-end path.
- **UX**: if a UI surface is involved.
- **Perf / observability / docs**: cost, logging, doc updates owed in the same change.

This is the cheap insurance an expert team would not skip. It is what makes a ticket cover the angles the author would not have thought of alone.

---

## Sizing

Map T-shirt to the tracker's native scale: XS (<1h, trivial), S (1-3h), M (3-8h, minor unknowns), L (1-2d, real complexity), XL (>2d, split unless truly indivisible).

---

## Red flags: STOP, the ticket is not ready

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "I will add the estimate later" | Estimate is a required field. An unestimated backlog cannot be planned. |
| "Labels do not matter for now" | At least one label, always. Filtering and routing depend on it. |
| "The agent will figure out the edges" | The edge-cases slot is where all-angles coverage lives. Empty = angles missed. |
| "Scope is obvious from the title" | The implementation agent has none of this conversation. Spell it out. |
| "No parent, it is standalone" | Orphan tickets rot. Link the epic or project. |

A ticket missing a required slot or field is not done, however clear it feels.

---

## Composition

Upstream: `void-brainstorm` and `void-plan` produced the thinking (or a `source: forge` spec did — see "Ingest first"); this skill captures it. Downstream: `void-implement` consumes the ticket and the passes it declares. On a project, follow that project's tracker doctrine (team, project, label and estimate conventions) rather than re-deciding them here; this skill stays the harness-doctrine layer (ingest, required slots, runner handoff).
